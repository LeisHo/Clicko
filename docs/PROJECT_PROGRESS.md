# Clicko — Project Progress

**This is a live document, not a log.** It holds only the current picture —
what's being worked on right now, what's recently done, and what's next. It
does **not** accumulate a running history of every past session; that
history already lives in `docs/CHANGELOG.txt` (the append-only, authoritative
record — see CLAUDE.md §4a/§4). Rewritten in place at each real update, not
appended to.

This doc functionally doubles as a handoff document: a brand-new AI chat
with no prior context should be able to read this file alone and know
exactly where the project currently stands, and pick up the work seamlessly
from there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Currently working on

Nothing in progress. Development here proceeds as rapid, conversational
iteration — no formal phase plan; features and bug reports arrive and get
resolved within the same session. There are 2+ Claude sessions frequently
active in this shared working tree at once (one has recently focused on
dev-panel architecture/nesting, another on Target/Speed/Ms-per-click/High
Score text behavior) — check `git status`/`git diff` on `index.html` before
editing, and preserve any concurrent session's uncommitted work exactly (see
CLAUDE.md §5).

## Recently completed

The dev panel's own architecture had a major couple of days: it's now a
mature, fully "Method B" (config-array-driven, no hand-written control HTML)
system with:
- **Unlimited group-nesting depth** — groups can be dragged into groups into
  groups, no longer capped at 1 level; settings can be dragged into a
  deeply-nested group too. (The 1-level cap itself was only ever a
  drag-target restriction, not a real data-model limit — `captureSection()`/
  `applySectionOrder()` were already fully recursive.)
- **Desktop → Mobile/Landscape group-order/rename sync**, extended to mirror
  nested groups too — re-derives automatically whenever you switch into the
  Mobile/Landscape tab.
- **Lazy dev-panel build** — its ~686 controls now only construct on first
  open (D key / DEV button / an eager build for `?dev=1` visitors, since the
  panel is visible-by-default for them), not unconditionally on every page
  load. Fixed a real player-facing load-time regression this surfaced
  (Game Mechanics controls had to stay eager — `startGame()`/`endGame()`
  read `sliderStartingSpeed`'s live DOM value as their actual source of
  truth, not a JS default).
- **Startup dev-panel flash, fully fixed** (2 separate root causes, both
  closed): the panel briefly showing for non-dev visitors before JS hid it,
  and — a second, later-found bug — a dev-mode visitor's panel briefly
  rendering at a wrong (viewport-centered) position before its saved
  left/top/width/height loaded.

Target Text (`targetCount`) also had a full architecture pass: split from
one bare number into independent Prefix ("Click ")/Number/Suffix (" x")
spans, each with its own font-size/X/Y-offset/letter-spacing/extrusion-depth/
border-thickness, plus independent hide checkboxes and Text Edit Mode
targets. Along the way, fixed a "stuck after edit" Text Edit Mode bug caused
by a detached-DOM-node pattern (see Open questions below — the same bug
still affects Speed/Ms-per-click Display, not yet fixed there).

Other recent features: a High Score display (localStorage-persisted, its
own full settings group, now correctly joins the win/lose color tint);
Ms/Click Display's suffix can now have an independently-tunable 2nd line
gap (for its 3-line mobile layout); Target Count's "Scale With Browser"
checkbox (blends each part's own px/vw font-size pair).

See `docs/CHANGELOG.txt` for full details and reasoning on all of the above
— every item here has its own detailed dated entry there.

## What's next

Nothing specifically queued. No outstanding user request is currently
unaddressed as of this doc's last update.

One old, possibly-stale backlog item from an earlier phase, never
implemented and not recently mentioned — surfaced here in case it's still
wanted, not because it's a confirmed priority: brightness sliders for the
button and base colors, alongside their existing color pickers.

## Open questions / blockers

- **Known bug, not yet fixed**: right-click-editing either the Speed
  Display or the Ms/Click Display in Text Edit Mode permanently detaches
  their child spans from the DOM after committing (the same "stuck"
  bug class already fixed for Target Count's Prefix/Suffix — `openTextEditFor()`
  wipes the shared wrapper's `innerHTML` while these 2 multi-child targets'
  `render()` functions write into now-detached cached node references).
  Confirmed pre-existing and reproducible; flagged but deliberately not
  fixed yet (out of scope for the task that found it).
- **Known limitation, narrow edge case**: `syncTabOrderToDesktop()`'s
  `findTranslated()` helper only searches 2 levels deep when placing a
  Mobile/Landscape-only orphan group with no Desktop counterpart — correct
  for the (now-unlimited-depth) main translation logic itself, but a
  device-only extra group nested 3+ levels deep with no Desktop counterpart
  could land at the wrong level. Requires both 3+ levels of nesting and a
  device-only group at that specific depth to matter; not pursued.
- **Known limitation, narrow edge case**: the reported "white screen, then
  ~1.5s total load" (beyond the now-fixed dev-panel flash itself) was
  flagged as a separate, larger load-performance question — a single large
  inline-script file plus a render-blocking Google Fonts stylesheet pulling
  15 font families — and not pursued as its own task yet.
